# AugmentedReality-ArucoPoseEstimation
A project based on Python and OpenCV which detects and recognizes aruco marker detects it and does its pose estimation with frame rate handling.

# Requirements
- Python
- Printed marker, you can print from [here](data/test_marker.jpg)

# Installation
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```
# Programs
- aruco_Detection.py : Basic marker detection from camera. 
- aruco_Detection.py : Find marker and estimate the pose. Needs calibration file as xml file. You can change the name in the code.

# Execute
python program_name.py
 
- Note : The other two files are supportive files. if you want only aruco code detection use aruco_detection.py and if you want only the frame rate handling use Handling_Framerate.py
